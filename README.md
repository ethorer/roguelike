# roguelike

This is a prototype of a roguelike game.  At the moment, the levels go on forever, and all there is to do is run around and fight the handful of enemies.  But the groundwork is there to make it a more substantial game.  It is very easy add new enemies, items, and effects (as in spells, weapon effects and consumable effects).  Adding new kinds of levels shouldn't be difficult, either.    

The game will only work on Windows at the moment.

Use the numpad or arrow keys to move and the decimal key to wait.
